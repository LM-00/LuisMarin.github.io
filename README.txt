This is my initial commit to my first copy-paste template website. 

I did edit all text seen on the website, including 3rd party links toggles. 


The website is labeled as my portfolio but it is just a "for fun" thing but 
I do intend to update the website once I start learning more. 
I currently do not have any type of coding knowledge, but I clearly will change that. 
	I am currently in Community College and will take a couple computer science classes.
	I will be double majoring in Mathematics and Physics with an AS.
	I do plan to transfer to a 4-year uni to acquire a BS in CompSci.
